# Who We Are and How We Discovered the Rulebreakers English Method

Rulebreakers English Studios was founded by **Ben Shepard** and **Job Zheng**, married collaborators since 2016 who create what they call *institutional performance art*—extended, adult make-believe organizations that function like real ones.  

Ben studied at the **University of Chicago** under performance artist **Tania Bruguera**, whose works—*Cathedra Arte*, *Immigrant Movement International*, *The Hannah Arendt Institute*—stage institutions as the artwork itself.  Already in college, Ben began making his own fictive systems: a temporary city on the Midway, a post-apocalyptic commune, and then **Kanye 4 Mayor**, a fake campaign for Kanye West to become mayor of Chicago.  The project went unexpectedly viral, appearing on MTV and BET—his first proof of how powerful institutional performance could be.  

Job and Ben met in **Shanghai**, both creating fictional organizations—fake art schools, studios, and collectives such as *ZaoFang* and *Dawn House* (造房, “to build a house”).  Wanting deeper context, they applied to Berlin’s **Universität der Künste / Institute for Art in Context**, where they focused formally on institutional performance art.  While there, they served as the first research fellows at **Mini-München**, a child-run model city that re-creates urban life each summer.  

At Mini-München they made their key discovery: children worked with astonishing intensity and joy.  They loved performing institutional life—running restaurants, designing bus routes, administering fake governments.  This observation—combined with their art practice and with linguist **Stephen Krashen’s** *Affective Filter* hypothesis (the idea that anxiety blocks language acquisition while play and purpose open it)—led to the concept of a new kind of English school.  

That school became **Rulebreakers English Studios**: a living artwork that teaches English by having students perform imaginary but functional organizations—theme parks, newspapers, architecture firms, studios, and startups.  It is a synthesis of art research, educational theory, and practical enterprise.
