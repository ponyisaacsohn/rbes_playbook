## Metrics & Outcomes

RBES measures outcomes beyond test scores — focusing on **fluency, creativity, confidence, and enterprise**.  
Each studio and workshop produces both *learning data* and *creative artifacts*.

## Learning Metrics

| Metric | Description | Measurement |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| **Fluency Growth** | Real-time improvement in speaking, writing, and comprehension | Instructor assessments and recordings |
| **Confidence Index** | Comfort using English publicly or collaboratively | Pre/post workshop surveys |
| **Creative Output** | Tangible projects completed (games, guides, installations, etc.) | Portfolio reviews |
| **Engagement Rate** | Attendance, punctuality, and project completion | Weekly analytics |
| **Retention** | Re-enrollment and ongoing mentorship | % of return participants |
