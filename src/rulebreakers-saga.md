# The Rulebreakers Saga

The **Rulebreakers Saga** is a long-running cycle of projects and fictions exploring how creativity, ownership, and education intersect.  
It began as an artistic practice — writing manuals for imaginary schools, fake companies, and speculative reform movements — and evolved into a working ecosystem of studios.

## Major Works and Spin-offs

| Project | Type | Status | Description |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| **The Rulebreakers Break the Performance Rule** | Publication / Performance | 2025 | A manifesto-document tracing the origins of RBES and the idea of institutional performance art. |
| **Unicornworld Imagineering** | Studio | Active | A kids’ studio where students design theme park zones and storyworlds. |
| **Experience Worker Media** | Studio / Media Company | Active | Produces lifestyle and travel content for the post-tourist era. |
| **English Is Money** | Game Studio | In development | Creates learning games connecting language with entrepreneurial logic. |
| **Infinite Thailand** | Conceptual Infrastructure | Ongoing | The parent world from which all other projects emerge. |

## From Saga to System

Each project in the Saga was originally fictional — a proposal, a myth, or a “pilot” for a world that didn’t yet exist.  
RBES represents the first moment when those experiments **crystallized into an operational system**: a real studio that inherits their aesthetics, methods, and ethos.
