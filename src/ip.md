# The Intellectual Property Already Created

For a decade we (Job Zheng & Ben Shepard) have been building IP platforms that now feed directly into **Rulebreakers English Studios**. RBES is not starting from zero — it’s a **port of a living universe** into a school.

We narrate that universe briefly below. External links go out to prior work; internal links point to RBES pages you can explore now or as we publish more.

---

## Unicornworld Imagineering → “Designing the impossible, then making it normal.”

An ongoing practice for building **fantasy environments** that behave like real places. Mall-scale installations, ride concepts, and the long-arc worldbuilding behind *Rulebreakers*.

- First stop: *The Happiest Place in the Mall* (Bangkok; installation).  
- At RBES: students co-design props, sets, and micro-attractions for public showings.  
- See also: [Studios](/studios/unicornworld/) (internal) · [Revenue](/revenue)

## Mean Babies Talent Management → “Cute, chaotic IP for all ages.”

A character/IP lab (e.g., **FAFA BABY**) and production wrapper for shorts, music, and merch. Built to test **hit-making** inside the school.

- At RBES: writers’ room + animation sprints + drops.  
- See: [Studios](/studios/mean-babies/) (internal)

---

## Clownpump Press → “Kids make culture.”

A newspaper / zine / imprint where **students write, illustrate, and ship**. Ads & sponsors keep the presses on; serialized fiction connects to Rulebreakers’ macro-story.

- At RBES: monthly issues, special editions, and compendia.  
- See: [Studios](/studios/clownpump/) (internal)

---

## Channel 99 → “Reality-sitcom becomes reality-business.”

Formats that blur show ↔ venue ↔ enterprise. Students learn English by **pitching, producing, and operating** pop-up experiences that the content itself advertises.

- At RBES: pilot “micro-shows,” licensing-ready formats.  
- See: [Studios](/studios/channel-99/) (internal)

---

## Experience Worker Media → “Travel and lifestyle for the post-tourist.”

Guides, feeds, and toolkits built by students in the city-as-campus.

- At RBES: field assignments → content → partners.  
- See: [Studios](/studios/experience-worker/) (internal)

---

## Social Arcology Lab → “City-scale imagination.”

Civic prototypes that connect markets to public space (e.g., **Tunnelparks**). Students learn to speak policy and business in the same breath.

## English Is Money (Gaming) → “Incentives make fluency inevitable.”

Game loops that **reward English-in-use**, not test-taking.

- At RBES: studio-built challenges, partner pilots.  
- See: [Revenue](/revenue)

---

## TMT Bottega → “Transpersonal painting and editions.”

A studio that lets students join fine-art production lines: from editions to commissions.

- At RBES: gallery window + marketplace experiments.  
- See: [Studios](/studios/tmt-bottega/) (internal)

---

## The Rulebreakers Storyworld

The literary backbone — characters, places, and rules — that show up in classes, sets, and live pieces.

### Why this matters for RBES

- **Motivation:** students aren’t “pretending to learn” — they’re joining worlds that already ship.  
- **Monetization:** IP → products → profit-share (see [Ownership](/ownership)).  
- **Meaning:** each file is both a tool and an artwork.
