# The Student Ownership System (SOS)

## 0. What It Is

The **Student Ownership System (SOS)** makes every student a co-owner in the Rulebreakers Studios.  
When a studio earns money — from ticket sales, consulting projects, game launches, art commissions, or media rights — the students who helped build those projects share the profits.

This means that the same people learning to create value are also the ones who receive it.  
Every participant is both a **student** and a **stakeholder.**

---

## 1. How It Works

Each student receives a small ownership share — expressed as **Studio Points** — in the studio or sub-project they help to build.  
These points track contribution (time, effort, creativity, leadership) and translate into real payout when a project makes money.

| Component | Function | Example |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| **Studio Points** | Track contribution and determine profit share. | A student who leads design for a Channel 99 show earns more points than a guest actor. |
| **Ownership Ledger** | Transparent record of who contributed what, and how much revenue is owed. | The ledger updates after each production, launch, or event. |
| **Payout Cycle** | Revenue distributed quarterly or at project close. | Income from an exhibition, client project, or online release gets divided automatically. |

## 2. What This Means in Practice

Each Rulebreakers Studio has its own potential revenue path — and students share in those outcomes:

| Studio | Example of Real Revenue | How Students Benefit |
|---|---|---|
| **Unicornworld Imagineering** | Admission fees from immersive park environments and public installations. | Students who designed attractions receive a share of ticket sales. |
| **Mean Babies Management** | Merchandising, licensing of original characters, brand collaborations. | Students who develop and manage “talent” receive royalties. |
| **Clownpump Press** | Book and zine sales, print-on-demand editions. | Contributors receive proportional payouts for each sold copy. |
| **Channel 99** | Advertising, streaming partnerships, live events. | Cast, editors, and producers share income when content monetizes. |
| **Experience Worker** | Corporate workshops, design consulting, applied research. | Adult learners who deliver client work share consulting fees. |
| **English Is Money Gaming** | Entry fees, sponsorships, and in-game marketplace activity. | Players, designers, and moderators earn from total game revenue. |
| **TMT Bottega** | Commissions, exhibition sales, or digital art editions. | Artists and facilitators share profits from sold works. |
| **Social Arcology Lab** | Grants and development funds for social prototypes. | Research teams share project budgets and outcomes. |
| **Infinite Thailand Solutions** | Cultural consulting, government and NGO contracts. | Analysts and project designers receive proportional revenue. |

Each example shows how learning activities directly connect to enterprise value.

## 3. The Ownership Calculator

Below is a simplified model of how SOS earnings can scale:

| Example Studio | Total Revenue (USD) | Student Pool Share | Students | Average Payout |
|-----------------|--------------------:|------------------:|----------:|----------------:|
| Unicornworld Installation | 30,000 | 30% | 10 | $900 per student |
| Channel 99 Series Pilot | 50,000 | 25% | 12 | $1,041 per student |
| English Is Money Tournament | 12,000 | 40% | 20 | $240 per student |
| Experience Worker Consulting | 20,000 | 35% | 8 | $875 per student |

*(These figures are examples — actual shares depend on contribution, revenue type, and studio performance.)*

The principle is simple: **if a studio makes money, everyone who built it earns money.**

## 4. Why It Matters

The SOS closes the gap between learning and livelihood.  
Instead of paying only for a class, students build enterprises that can return income to them.  
This creates behavioral alignment: when studios succeed, learning itself becomes profitable.

Ownership transforms motivation from abstract (“get better at English”) to concrete (“help launch this show, earn real money, and improve your English doing it”).  
It turns education into a working creative economy.

---

## 5. The Bigger Picture

The SOS is the microeconomic model inside **∞泰 (Infinite Thailand)** — the national-scale framework where education and enterprise merge.  
As more studios connect, the shared ownership system becomes a distributed creative economy: thousands of small student-owners driving Thailand’s next creative generation.
