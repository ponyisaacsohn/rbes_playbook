## Shared Ownership

At Rulebreakers English Studios, **everyone is an owner** — not only the co-founders or instructors, but also the students themselves.  
This principle, called **FAFA (Fictional Asset / Functional Asset)**, redefines what it means to “attend” a school: participation equals partial ownership.

## The FAFA Model

Each studio functions as both a **learning environment** and a **creative startup**.  
Students receive a symbolic and measurable **equity share** in the projects they co-create — such as publications, games, installations, or digital properties.

| Role | Description | Share Allocation |
|------|--------------|-----------------:|
| **CoZheng (co-founder)** | Lead concept and curriculum design | 4,081,500 |
| **ShepArdInv (co-founder)** | Operations, design, performance systems | 720,900 |
| **Angel Investors** | Seed and initial launch funding | 720,900 |
| **Support / Apprentices** | Thai teachers, facilitators, interns | 1,000,000 |
| **Students (collective pool)** | Studio members with performance shares | 1,000,000 |
| **Reserve (reinvestment)** | Future studios, scholarships, maintenance | 2,000,000 |

## Distribution Mechanism

- Each **studio** maintains its own ledger of project-based assets (games, films, guides, performances).  
- Upon publication or monetization, a proportional return is distributed to participants.  
- The **central pool** of RBES equity rewards long-term collaboration and experimentation.

This is not merely symbolic. It is a structural attempt to **turn learning into ownership**, and **school into enterprise** — so that education itself becomes a form of creative capital.
