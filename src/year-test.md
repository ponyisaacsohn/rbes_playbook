## The Year-Long Test of Concept

The **Year-Long Test of Concept** is our hypothesis:  
what happens if Rulebreakers English Studios runs continuously for a full year?

The goal is to observe, document, and measure the method in real operation —  
to see whether an institution built on *Osmotic Learning* can sustain itself pedagogically, socially, and structurally.

## Framework

The experiment runs from **June 2025 → June 2026** and is divided into four twelve-week cycles.  
Each cycle includes:

1. **Studio Operations** — each participant works within a studio to produce tangible output.  
2. **Workshop Weeks** — intensive three-day pop-ups for new participants and idea testing.  
3. **Showcase & Reflection** — public sharing, internal evaluation, and publication of results.

The year serves as both curriculum and prototype: a working proof that the studios can educate and operate simultaneously.

## Core Questions

- Can *Osmotic Learning* produce measurable language acquisition without direct instruction?  
- Can studios generate and document real cultural and educational value?  
- How do authorship, ownership, and performance interact inside a make-believe institution?  
- What kind of data and artifacts can a living school produce?

## Metrics

**Language Development** – weekly written and spoken documentation from participants.  
**Cultural Output** – media, games, texts, performances generated by studios.  
**Institutional Data** – logs of operations, decision-making, and internal structures.  
**Social Viability** – enrollment, engagement, collaborative retention.  

---

## Outcome

By the end of the year we expect two deliverables:

1. A repeatable educational framework demonstrating the effectiveness of *Osmotic Learning*.  
2. A functioning institutional model that operates as both artwork and enterprise.  

This year is the bridge from idea to institution.
