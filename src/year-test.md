# The Year-Long Test of Concept

Up to this point, everything in Rulebreakers English Studios has been speculation — ideas, models, and imagination.  

The Year-Long Test of Concept is designed to change that. It is the experiment that will prove whether the method actually works — whether people can learn English faster and better by running make-believe institutions that generate real value.  

---

### Objective

The goal is straightforward: to demonstrate that Rulebreakers English Studios can function as both an effective educational system and a self-sustaining creative business.  

The test year will measure whether our structure — part school, part enterprise — can operate continuously, produce measurable language growth, and finance itself through studio activity.  

---

### Structure

The experiment runs from **June 2025 to June 2026** in a **storefront in Bangkok**. It is divided into four twelve-week cycles, each containing:  

- **Studio Operations** – participants work inside one of nine studios to produce tangible outputs: media, design, architecture, and games.  
- **Workshop Weeks** – open three-day sessions for new participants and rapid prototyping.  
- **Showcase & Reflection** – public exhibitions, publications, and evaluation of results.  

Around **30 paying participants** form the initial cohort. Their tuition provides the operational base for staff, teachers, and materials — allowing the studios themselves to operate as functioning creative companies.

### The Storefront

The storefront serves as both **workspace and display** — a transparent creative office where the studios are visible to the public.  

Passersby can enter, observe, or purchase outcomes: publications, games, performances, or small-scale designs. Each week a different studio leads operations, keeping the space alive with new work.  

---

### Evaluation

The year tests two linked hypotheses:  

1. **Educational Proof** — that participants’ English improves faster through creation, negotiation, and collaboration than through conventional instruction.  
2. **Economic Proof** — that a school built as a creative enterprise can sustain itself through its own production, workshops, and events.  

Metrics will include:  

- Documented student progress in writing, fluency, and collaboration.  
- Tangible cultural output: media, exhibits, and client prototypes.  
- Financial balance sheets for each studio.  
- Public and institutional engagement.

### Deliverables

By **June 2026**, the year should yield:  

1. A **verified educational framework** demonstrating clear language progress through creative production.  
2. A **working business model** for a sustainable, scalable Rulebreakers English Studios.  
3. A **public archive** documenting the entire year — its outputs, finances, and learning data.  

Everything before this has been theory.  
This is the year we find out if it works.
