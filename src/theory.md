## Theory

**The Rulebreakers English Method** is based on **Osmotic Learning** —  
learning that occurs through immersion in a meaningful, designed environment.  

Osmotic Learning can be expressed as an equation:

> **Dewey + Vygotsky + Krashen + Institutional Performance Art = Osmotic Learning**

Each component contributes a mechanism of learning proven through research.

## (1) John Dewey — Learning by Doing

Dewey proposed that knowledge is created through *experience and reflection*, not passive instruction.  
His principle of **Project-Based Learning** (Dewey, *Experience and Education*, 1938) laid the groundwork for modern experiential education.  
A meta-analysis by Hmelo-Silver (2004) found that project-based environments increase motivation, retention, and conceptual understanding.

**At RBES:** every session is a project. Students learn English by designing, building, and presenting real outputs.

## (2) Lev Vygotsky — Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) & Scaffolding

Vygotsky’s theory (1978) describes learning as a social process: students progress when supported by peers or mentors just beyond their current ability.  
Scaffolding theory, extended by Wood, Bruner & Ross (1976), formalized this mechanism.

**At RBES:** studios are built as collaborative scaffolds.  
Students and instructors co-perform tasks, and English emerges as the shared working language inside that collaboration.

## (3) Stephen Krashen — The Affective Filter

Krashen’s *Affective Filter Hypothesis* (1977) identifies emotional state as the gatekeeper of language acquisition.  
When anxiety is low and motivation is high, input becomes intake.  
MacIntyre & Gardner (1991) confirmed that positive affect strongly correlates with L2 fluency.

**At RBES:** the studios remove the anxiety of performance by turning it into play.  
There are no tests, only projects that matter.

---

## (4) Institutional Performance Art (IPA)

Developed within contemporary art by practitioners like **Tania Bruguera**, IPA treats the institution itself as a medium.  
The artwork is not an object but a functioning structure.  
In this model, behavior, administration, and context become the performance.

**At RBES:** the school *is* the artwork.  
Running it is the method. Every administrative act is also pedagogical; the institution teaches by being lived.

## (5) Synthesis — Osmotic Learning

When we combine these four components, the result is **Osmotic Learning**:

| Component | Function | Effect in RBES |
|------------|-----------|----------------|
| Dewey | Experience as curriculum | Projects create context for language |
| Vygotsky | Social collaboration | Scaffolding turns peers into teachers |
| Krashen | Emotional state | Play and purpose lower anxiety |
| IPA | Structure as medium | The institution itself becomes a classroom |

**Osmotic Learning = Environment × Motivation × Meaning**

Students acquire language because they are immersed in a world they help design, operate, and believe in.

---

## Implication

Traditional education separates *what is learned* from *why it matters.*  
Osmotic Learning reunites them.  
Rulebreakers English Studios exists to demonstrate that when form and function merge, learning becomes performance.
