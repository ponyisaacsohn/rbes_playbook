title: "Learning With Stakes: Modeling the Rulebreakers English Studios Ownership System"
---

## Abstract

At **Rulebreakers English Studios (RBES)**, English is learned not by simulation but by enterprise.  
This paper presents a working model for the **Student Ownership System (SOS)**—a framework that transforms learning into real participation in creative ventures.  
We combine **behavioral economics**, **educational psychology**, and **institutional performance art** to design an educational economy that rewards collaboration, risk, and imagination.  

---

## 1. Origins and Rationale

The SOS arose from a decade of experiments in *institutional performance art*—fictional organizations enacted seriously enough to change the world around them.  
The hypothesis: if people act as though an institution is real, its effects become real.  
This became the operating principle of RBES: a school that functions like a set of startups and a startup that behaves like a school.

### Historical Parallels

- **Bauhaus (1919–1933):** fused art, craft, and industry under collective authorship.  
- **Mondragon Cooperatives (1956–):** worker-owned institutions balancing profit and pedagogy.  
- **Mini-München (1978–):** a temporary city run by children; proof that learning accelerates when roles are real.

RBES adapts these traditions into a contemporary Thai context—where English, art, and entrepreneurship intersect.

## 2. The Ownership Model

### Structural Design

| Component | Definition | Function |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Studio Points** | Earned for creative contribution, leadership, and collaboration | Quantify ownership dynamically |
| **Student Pool (20%)** | Portion of studio net revenue allocated to students | Collective dividend |
| **Conversion Mechanism** | Converts points into revenue or equity | Incentivizes long-term engagement |
| **Ledger** | Transparent record of all allocations | Accountability layer |

### Mathematical Model

Let  
\( N = \) studio net profit,  
\( p = \) pool proportion (0.20),  
\( s_i = \) points held by student *i*,  
\( S = \) total student points.

Then payout \( R_i = N × p × (s_i / S) \).  

In practice, ledgers are updated per cycle, producing visible performance metrics for every contributor.

## 3. Behavioral and Cognitive Foundations

The SOS operationalizes what the following bodies of research imply:

1. **Krashen (1982):** anxiety lowers acquisition; SOS removes fear of failure by replacing tests with real work.  
2. **Kolb (1984):** experience and reflection constitute the learning loop; SOS externalizes experience as shared enterprise.  
3. **Deci & Ryan (2000):** intrinsic motivation flourishes under autonomy, competence, and relatedness—all embedded structurally.  
4. **Kahneman & Tversky (1979):** stakes intensify attention; the SOS provides bounded stakes—enough to motivate, not to paralyze.  
5. **Bruner (1986):** narrative intelligence frames identity; SOS transforms students into protagonists of the institutional story.

## 4. Comparative Landscape

| Model | Description | Limitation | RBES Difference |
|--------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| **ESOP (Employee Stock Ownership Plan)** | Workers receive shares over time | Requires full corporate structure | Simplified, education-first implementation |
| **Cooperative Schooling** | Shared decision-making in pedagogy | Symbolic participation only | Tangible financial outcomes |
| **Accelerator / Startup Labs** | Short-term project incubators | Competitive, extractive | Cooperative, pedagogical |
| **Gamified EdTech Platforms** | Use points & badges | No link to real-world value | Convertible, auditable value |

RBES bridges the creative and economic by making *ownership the pedagogy itself.*

## 5. Modeling Scenarios

### Example 1: Base Case
N = 2,000,000 THB · p = 20% · sᵢ = 120 · S = 6,000  
→ Rᵢ = 8,000 THB  

### Example 2: Growth Case
Studio scales to N = 10,000,000 THB with stable S = 6,000  
→ Rᵢ = 40,000 THB  
Sustained participation yields cumulative benefit equivalent to partial tuition refund.

### Example 3: Spin-Out Case
A sub-studio (e.g., *Mean Babies Management*) formalizes into a company; 20% of founder equity mirrors the student pool distribution.  
Early students retain royalties proportional to their studio points.  
The lesson: long-term incentive alignment is pedagogically and economically rational.

## 6. The Psychology of Stakes

Why stakes matter:

- **Attention:** People attend to what affects them.  
- **Memory:** Emotional salience reinforces retention (McGaugh, 2003).  
- **Identity:** Shared ownership creates role continuity between school and life.  
- **Community:** Risk and reward generate solidarity; nothing builds belonging like a shared ledger.  

---

## 7. Cultural and Ethical Dimensions

Thailand’s social economy prizes harmony, generosity, and face.  
RBES aligns these cultural logics with entrepreneurship:

- Collective rather than competitive equity.  
- Transparent recognition of contribution.  
- Education as mutual prosperity.  

Safeguards include:
- Guardian-managed trusts for minors.  
- Legal partnerships compliant with Thai cooperative law.  
- Annual third-party review of ledgers.  

---

## 8. Theoretical Implications

The SOS reframes education as **distributed authorship**.  
Rather than grading isolated output, it measures how individuals contribute to evolving systems.  
It embodies what might be called **metamodern pedagogy**—oscillating between sincerity and pragmatism, art and business, ideal and implementation.

---

## 9. Future Research Directions

1. **Quantitative**: longitudinal tracking of language proficiency vs. ownership engagement.  
2. **Qualitative**: ethnographic analysis of identity change in participants.  
3. **Economic**: modeling the multiplier effects of student-owned creative ventures in Thai GDP terms.  
4. **Technological**: exploring blockchain micro-ledgers for auditability.  
5. **Comparative**: cross-cultural replication in other post-industrial or emerging contexts.

## 10. Toward ∞泰: Education as National Infrastructure

Infinite Thailand envisions the RBES model scaled into a network of English-through-creation studios.  
Each studio becomes a node in a distributed innovation economy—one that grows from language into design, production, and export.  
The SOS is its cellular structure: transparent, fair, and motivational.  
A school that teaches through enterprise eventually teaches a nation to renew itself.

## 11. Conclusion

> *When students co-own the outcome, learning stops being rehearsal and becomes performance.*

Ownership replaces the abstraction of evaluation with the concreteness of consequence.  
It converts the emotional economy of anxiety into the cognitive economy of creation.  
In time, RBES hopes to prove that language learning can drive GDP, dignity, and delight simultaneously.
