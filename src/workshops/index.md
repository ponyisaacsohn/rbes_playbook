# Workshops

The workshops are the experimental front line of Rulebreakers English Studios — the place where the method is tested, refined, and opened to new participants.

### Function
Each workshop is both **research** and **recruitment**.  
It tests how the Rulebreaker Method functions in practice while identifying students, teachers, and collaborators who may join the studios.  
Every participant leaves with a tangible artifact — a piece of their portfolio — created inside a live simulation.

### Structure
Workshops follow a simple rhythm:  
**Three days**, **three hours** each, with a shared presentation or “showing” on the final evening.  
The atmosphere is deliberately safe and conversational; people are encouraged to listen, to ask, and to speak without fear of error.  
English is not performed for correctness, but for connection and creation.

### Studio Connection
Each workshop corresponds to one of the studios and mirrors its internal logic:
- **Unicornworld Imagineering:** participants design a themed “zone” of a fictional park.  
- **Meanbabies Management:** teams practice Triadic Management, producing a short creative work.  
- **Clownpump Press:** groups write and lay out an issue of the *Rulebreakers English Newspaper.*  
- **Channel 99:** participants plan and shoot a brief show pilot.  
- **Experience Worker:** teams script and stage an experience or short travel video.  
- **Social Arcology Lab:** groups sketch urban interventions tied to the Infinite Thailand Vision.  
- **English Is Money Gaming:** design a playable language economy.  
- **Infinite Thailand Strategies:** simulate a consulting brief for one of the hypothetical clients.  
- **TMT Bottega:** co-create a collective artwork or installation.

### Cycle
Workshops are continuous; new sessions are scheduled whenever instructors, resources, and momentum align.  
They form an ongoing cycle of experimentation feeding directly into the evolution of RBES.

### Integration
Some participants move on to collaborate more deeply inside the studios; others leave with the experience alone.  
In every case, the workshops serve as a living demonstration of how language can be learned through action, design, and imagination.
