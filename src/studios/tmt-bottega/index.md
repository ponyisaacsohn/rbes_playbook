# TMT — The Transpersonal Making Team

> *"When the work begins to make you, something greater has entered the studio."*

## 1. What Is Transpersonal Making?

The **“transpersonal”** comes from *transpersonal psychology* — a branch of study born in the late 1960s to explore experiences that transcend the boundaries of the individual self.  
Its earliest subjects were mystical experiences, psychedelic visions, and spiritual awakenings — but it soon extended into **creative practice**, where the same ego-dissolving force appears in the act of making.

In other words, *to make transpersonally is to make beyond oneself.*

---

## 2. Collaboration and the “Third Mind”

Writers **William S. Burroughs** and **Brion Gysin** coined the phrase **“The Third Mind”** to describe the emergent intelligence that appears whenever two creators truly collaborate.  
Something larger than either person starts making decisions.  
The painting paints the painter.  
The writing writes the writer.  
The work becomes a participant in its own creation.

That’s what TMT studies and practices — *art as a cooperative trance.*

## 3. Transpersonal Media

TMT operates across three domains, each with its own rituals and experiments:

### 🖌️ Transpersonally Made Paintings
Paintings that depict — and are made within — altered collaborative states.  
Each piece attempts to visualize what cannot normally be seen: *the field of shared imagination.*

### 📷 Transpersonal Photography
Images produced through guided sessions in which both subject and photographer enter a mutual perceptual flow.  
The resulting photos seem to come from a third observer in the room.

### 💠 Transpersonal Pixels
Digital works, from video to design systems, that use algorithmic co-creation and generative tools as spiritual instruments — pixels guided by intuition and emergence rather than control.

---

## 4. Why a “Team”?

Because transpersonal art is never truly solitary.  
Even when you work alone, you collaborate with **past and future selves**, with the medium itself, and with the field of attention that arises around the work.  
TMT is structured as a **collective atelier** inside Rulebreakers English Studios — a place where painters, coders, writers, and dreamers can co-enter this space together.

## 5. Sample Works

### *“The Tricksmith’s Pet”*  
Detail from a collaborative painting exploring the paradox of playful control — who is painting whom?

### *“I See a Face”*  
An experiment in pareidolia and shared perception.  
Do you see the same face the artist saw?

### *Block City Bridges*  
A transpersonal photograph — neither staged nor accidental — where the Third Mind itself seems to compose the geometry.

## 6. Invitation

TMT is open to new collaborators, apprentices, and visiting spirits.  
If you have ever felt that a piece of art was *making you*, you already belong here.
