# Experience Worker

Experience Worker is a media and hospitality studio dedicated to improving the art of experience itself.

### The Structure
There are eight Experience Workers:
1. The Dumb Traveler 2. The Food Wizard 3. The Vibe Scribe 4. The Museum Guru  
5. The Tricksmith 6. The City Idealist 7. The Angry Ambientologist 8. The Aesthetic Warrior  

Each embodies a mode of perceiving and producing experience.

### The Method
Workshops develop content like *The Dumb Traveler’s Guide to Pad Thai in Bangkok*—practical, humorous, and filmable.  
The second wing designs **Experience Worker Clubs**, imagined as social hubs that can later evolve into boutique hotels.

### The Practice
Teams plan, script, and shoot short media pieces while learning hospitality English: how to describe, host, and design emotion.  

### The Future
From finite media content to infinite infrastructure—Experience Worker will grow into real spaces of lived design.
