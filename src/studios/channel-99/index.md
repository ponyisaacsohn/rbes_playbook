# Channel 99

Channel 99 is RBES’s streaming studio and production network—where fiction and reality are co-produced.

### The Structure
The studio contains three production companies:
- **CoGirls Productions** – creators of *CoGirls Café*, a sitcom that doubles as a real café in Bangkok.  
- **C30 Pictures** – produces films for viewers 30 and over, confronting the *Finite Timeline* through cautionary storytelling.  
- **Idiot Pictures** – makes *wissenkunst* films: art-history, philosophy, and politics told as pleasure.

### The Method
Workshops operate like real production rooms: writing, casting, directing, editing.  
English functions as the shared production language—scripts, budgets, and meetings are all done in English.

### The Purpose
Channel 99 documents both timelines—the worlds that could end, and those that might continue.  
It trains participants to speak and collaborate across fiction and fact.
