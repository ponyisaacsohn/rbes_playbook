# Clownpump Press

Clownpump Press is the publishing arm of the Rulebreakers universe—turning the internal mythologies of RBES into physical English-language media.

### The Myth
Clownpump Press exists inside the Rulebreakers, FafaBaby, and StarKid worlds as a legendary publishing house that prints impossible stories, field manuals, and propaganda.  
Its flagship title is the **Rulebreakers English Newspaper**, which mixes fiction, reportage, and language exercises.

### The Studio
In practice, Clownpump Press runs workshops where participants create real magazines, books, and newspapers derived from the RBES worlds.  
Writers, editors, designers, and sales teams work together to produce tangible media.

### The Practice
Students develop English-only copy, sell real ads, and distribute printed issues to schools and partner spaces.  
English is learned through writing, editing, negotiation, and layout.

### The Future
The Press will expand into the full **Rulebreakers publishing network**, documenting the unfolding universes while building a sustainable print economy.
