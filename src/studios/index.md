# The Studios

The studios are the working units of Rulebreakers English Studios — semi-fictional institutions that double as learning environments and prototype enterprises.  
Each has its own language, projects, and economy.  
Participants join them as collaborators, extending worlds that already exist.  
Over time, the make-believe gives way to operations, and the performances begin to earn real value.  
Together, the nine studios form the operational ecosystem of Rulebreakers English Studios.
