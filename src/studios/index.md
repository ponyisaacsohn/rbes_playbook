## The Studios

At Rulebreakers English Studios, **each studio is both a classroom and a company** — an imaginary enterprise that teaches English through performance, collaboration, and creative production.  
Students don’t study English; they *run* institutions in English. Every team builds real media, research, and design outputs that become part of the Rulebreakers ecosystem.  

Each studio focuses on a distinct discipline — from journalism to worldbuilding — but all share the same goal: learning through *doing real things that matter*.

## How the Studios Work

Each studio operates as a **semi-autonomous company** inside the larger RBES ecosystem.  
Participants join teams for defined cycles (usually 6–12 weeks). Each cycle ends with a *real output* — an exhibition, publication, or product that can stand in the world.

English emerges naturally from these processes:
- **Writing** becomes documentation and publication.  
- **Speaking** becomes pitching, interviewing, or performing.  
- **Listening and Reading** become research, collaboration, and response.  

By the end of each cycle, students have not just improved fluency — they’ve built things that actually exist.

## Long-Term Goal
Together, the studios form a **microcity of learning institutions**, each with its own culture and economy.  
The eventual vision is for these studios to sustain themselves as small, interconnected ventures — collectively forming the first *Rulebreakers Campus.*
