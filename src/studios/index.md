# What Are These Studios?

At Rulebreakers English Studios, learning happens by doing real work inside semi-fictional enterprises. Each studio functions as a pedagogical startup — a fiction structured to become real. Students join as collaborators and co-founders within a living creative ecosystem. English becomes the working language of design, production, and imagination.

## How Learning Generates Value

Students at RBES learn English by doing meaningful creative work that can also generate real revenue.  
Practice in the studios improves language ability, while performance in those same studios can create income and shared ownership.
