# Social Arcology Lab (SAL)

SAL is the architecture and urban-planning wing of RBES, founded 2016 in Shanghai as part of the *Dawn House* project.

### The Mission
SAL designs infrastructures for the **Infinite Timeline**—spaces that embody continuity and shared intelligence.

### Current Focus – *Infinite Thailand Vision*
Nine associated projects:  
1. Bangkok Tunnelparks 2. The National Boardwalk 3. The Green Loop 4. The Dome Zone  
5. The Silom Arcology 6. Chinatown 3.0 7. RiFirenze 8. NeoAthens 9. Bang Kachao Bolo  

### The Method
Workshops mix architecture, storytelling, and systems design.  
English is the lingua franca for drawings, proposals, and presentations.

### The Goal
To manifest the Infinite Timeline through real, buildable forms—cities that learn.
