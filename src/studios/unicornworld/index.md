# Unicornworld Imagineering

Unicornworld Imagineering builds **walk-in experiences** where imagined worlds become places.

### The Myth
Inside the **Unicornworld Saga**, the STAR unicorn **Nichlolas** lives in a chemically induced utopia—an endless, televised paradise owned by the Moraine Family Trust.  
The audience watches Nichlolas sing the Great Morning Song, invent new foods, and DJ waterfalls—never realizing the world is a zoo-show.  
The saga follows Nichlolas’ journey to find the *real* Unicornworld.

### The Studio
For youth ~17–18 who want to design worlds you can walk through.  
Workshops focus on spatial storytelling and experiential architecture.  
Year-one project: a **mall-scale photo/experience set** where visitors invent and photograph their own characters and worlds.

### The Practice
Students act as **Imagineers**: storyboards, environment sketches, small-scale fabrication.  
English is used for pitching, documentation, and collaboration—**English as design software**.

### The Future
Long-term vision: a **real theme park** combining zones from the *Unicornworld Saga*, *Rulebreakers Cycle*, and *FafaBaby Worlds*.
