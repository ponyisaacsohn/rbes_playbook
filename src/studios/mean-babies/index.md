# Meanbabies Management

Meanbabies Management operates as a **fictional talent-management company** training artists to manage both themselves and others.

### The Myth
The *Meanbabies* first appear in the Rulebreakers Saga as tiny, furious creatures carried by Holy Sloths—each one a parody of ego, fear, and control.  
Across the polyverse they kidnap heroes and must be rescued or integrated.

### The Studio
In RBES, the studio helps participants **work with their inner Meanbabies**—the parts that block collaboration or creation.  
Through a system called **Triadic Management**, every participant is both manager and managed.  
Workshops simulate a functioning agency producing content from the Rulebreakers, FafaBaby, and StarKid universes.

### The Practice
Each project begins with role assignment and negotiation sessions:  
artists wear “Meanbaby hats” or glasses to safely act out critical or possessive instincts.  
Teams then co-produce short works—videos, stories, prototypes—learning to convert friction into production.

### The Goal
Meanbabies Management teaches how to transform conflict into creative energy.  
When the studio eventually connects to the public, it will package cross-world characters and products emerging from RBES.
