# Infinite Thailand Strategies (ITS)

Infinite Thailand Strategies is RBES’s consulting and research studio — connecting Thailand’s finite industries to the Infinite Timeline.

### The Concept
The Finite Timeline ends; the Infinite Timeline continues.  
ITS aligns tourism, food, hospitality, and property development with infinite ethics and design.

### Hypothetical Clients
1. **Tourism Authority of Thailand** – cultural infrastructure and sustainable travel  
2. **Major Food Company** – scaling a Thai brand internationally  
3. **Experience Worker Lodges** – a new hospitality model  
4. **Tunnelpark Property Group** – developing the land around Bangkok’s Tunnelparks

### The Practice
Workshops simulate real consulting firms: briefs, presentations, strategy decks, and negotiations — all in English.  
Teams analyze, design, and pitch Infinite-aligned business models.

### The Goal
To demonstrate how policy, enterprise, and imagination can coexist on an infinite timeline —  
turning speculative consulting into real, ethical development.
