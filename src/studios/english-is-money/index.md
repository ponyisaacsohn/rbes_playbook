# English Is Money Gaming

A studio exploring how games can teach language, economy, and collaboration all at once.

### The Three Operational Ideas
1. **Gamify the Studios** – each RBES studio becomes a game (FarmVille for Imagineering).  
2. **English = Money Circuit** – players earn for fluency and participation.  
3. **Enterprise Licensing** – partner with large companies needing English training software.

### The Method
Workshops prototype board games, apps, and simulations linking language learning to value creation.

### The Context
Developed with Infinite Thailand Strategies, it operates between finite incentive structures and infinite education.

### The Goal
To turn learning English into an economy of meaning and reward.
