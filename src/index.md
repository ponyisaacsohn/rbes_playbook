Rulebreakers English Studios is a prototype for a new kind of English school.  
Instead of sitting in classrooms, students create imaginary startups which become real.  
Instead of taking tests, they [design roller coasters](../studios/unicornworld/), [create animated films](../studios/mean-babies/), [publish newspapers](../studios/clownpump/), [craft REIT proposals](../studios/infinite-thailand/), [write sitcoms](../studios/channel-99/), [research the optimal Pad Thai](../studios/experience-worker/), [architect tunnelparks](../studios/social-arcology/), [code games](../studios/english-is-money/), and [paint collaboratively](../studios/tmt-bottega/).

This is not (just) a performance-art piece; it is meant to be a real enterprise.  

This site is for future students and investors. On it, you’ll learn:  
(1) [Who we are](../background/),  
(2) [The popup workshops running now](../workshops/),  
(3) [The year-long test of concept](../year-test/),  
(4) [The theory behind the model](../theory/),  
(5) [The revenue model](../revenue/),  
(6) [The budget](../budget/),  
(7) [The metrics and outcomes](../metrics/),  
(8) [The intellectual context](../context/), and  
(9) [The shared ownership program](../ownership/).
