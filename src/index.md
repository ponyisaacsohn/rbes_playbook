# Rulebreakers English Studios (The Plan)

Rulebreakers English Studios is a startup disguised as a school disguised as a startup.  
**USP:** English via *Institutional Performance Art.*

Instead of lectures, students **design worlds** in the [Unicornworld Imagineering Studio](/studios/unicornworld/).  
Instead of teachers, they **co-manage animation projects** with peers in [Meanbabies Management](/studios/mean-babies/).  
Instead of homework, they **publish stories and media** through [Clownpump Press](/studios/clownpump/).  
Instead of business classes, they **prototype imaginary economies** in [Infinite Thailand Solutions](/studios/infinite-thailand/).  
Instead of conversation drills, they **host live interviews** in [Channel 99](/studios/channel-99/).  
Instead of essays, they **produce lifestyle journalism** in [Experience Worker Media](/studios/experience-worker/).  
Instead of architecture theory, they **simulate societies** in [Social Arcology Lab](/studios/social-arcology/).  
Instead of logic puzzles, they **design economies-as-games** in [English Is Money Gaming](/studios/english-is-money/).  
Instead of marketing exercises, they **build real brands** through [TMT Bottega](/studios/tmt-bottega/).

This is **The Plan** — for turning this idea into reality in three moves:  
[Workshops](/workshops/), [Year-Long Test of Concept](/year-test/), and [Infinite Thailand](/context/).

It’s written for [students](/ownership/), [teachers](/workshops/), and [collaborators and investors](/angel/):  
those who will build the studios, teach within them, and fund their proof of concept.
