Rulebreakers English Studios is a startup disguised as a school disguised as a startup.  

The USP: Learn English via institutional performance art — extended make-believe.  

Instead of classes, there’s **creative collaboration** in one of the [Rulebreakers Studios](/studios/).   Instead of taking tests, students in the [Unicornworld Imagineering](/studios/unicornworld/) studio **design theme parks**.   Instead of homework, students working in the [Channel 99](/studios/channel-99/) studio **plot, film, edit, and market sitcoms.**  

This is *The Plan* — for turning this idea into reality in three moves: **Workshops**, **Year-Long Test of Concept**, and **Infinite Thailand.** It’s written for students, teachers, collaborators, and investors — those who will build the studios, teach within them, and fund their proof of concept.
