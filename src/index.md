title: Rulebreakers English Studios (The Plan)
---
Rulebreakers English Studios is a startup disguised as a school disguised as a startup.  
**USP:** English via *Institutional Performance Art.*

Instead of lectures, students [design worlds](/studios/unicornworld/) in the **Unicornworld Imagineering Studio.**  
Instead of teachers, they [co-write animated films](/studios/meanbabies/) with their peers in **Mean Babies Animation Lab.**  
Instead of homework, they [publish newspapers](/studios/experienceworker/) in **Experience Worker Media.**  
Instead of business classes, they [research the perfect Pad Thai](/studios/padthai/) at the **Pad Thai Optimization Bureau.**  
Instead of architecture theory, they [draw tunnelparks](/studios/tunnelpark/) in **Tunnelpark Architecture.**  
Instead of conversation drills, they [host live interviews](/studios/channel99/) on **Channel 99.**  
Instead of logic puzzles, they [design games](/studios/gameeconomy/) in the **Game Economy Studio.**  
Instead of sociology essays, they [simulate future cities](/studios/socialarcology/) in **Social Arcology.**  
Instead of marketing exercises, they [build brands](/studios/tmtbottega/) inside **TMT Bottega.**

This is **The Plan** for turning that idea into reality in three moves —  
[Workshops](/workshops/), [Year-Long Test of Concept](/year-test/), and [Infinite Thailand](/context/).

It’s written for [student-owners](/ownership/), [teachers](/who/), [workshop collaborators](/workshops/), and [angel investors](/angel/) —  
those who will build the studios, teach inside them, collaborate on their workshops, and fund their proof of concept.
