title: Rulebreakers English Studios Playbook
---

Rulebreakers English Studios is a prototype for a new kind of English school.  
Instead of sitting in classrooms, students create imaginary startups which become real.  
Instead of taking tests, they design roller coasters, create animated films, publish newspapers, craft REIT proposals, write sitcoms, research the optimal Pad Thai, architect tunnelparks, code games, and paint collaboratively.  

This playbook is both for future student-owners and investors.  

On it, youâ€™ll learn:  
(1) [Who we are](background),  
(2) [The popup workshops running now](workshops),  
(3) [The year-long test of concept](year-test),  
(4) [The theory behind the model](theory),  
(5) [The revenue model](revenue),  
(6) [The budget](budget),  
(7) [The metrics and outcomes](metrics),  
(8) [The intellectual context](context), and  
(9) [The shared ownership program](ownership).
