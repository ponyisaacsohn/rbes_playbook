The fastest way to learn English is to forget youâ€™re learning it.  At **Rulebreakers English Studios**, students forget by performing as imagineers, talent managers, editors, consultants, showrunners, ambientologists, social arcologists, game designers and collaborative painters. 

- Instead of grammar drills, students design [theme parks ](/studios/unicornworld/).  
- Instead of listening comprehension, [pitching story ideas for a reality sitcom](/studios/channel-99/).  
- Instead of tests, [product launches](/studios/meanbabies/).  
- Instead of grades, [revenue checks after the product launches](/studios/experience-worker/).  

This plan is for potential students-owners, teachers, angel investors, or curious supporters. It has nine main parts, and many secret sections to discover.
