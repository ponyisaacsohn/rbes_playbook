## The Workshops

Before building full studios, Rulebreakers English Studios tests each idea in miniature.  
Each **workshop** is a *three-day, three-hour* sprint that condenses a studio into a single intensive burst of collaboration.  
The format is simple:

- **Wednesday:** concept and immersion  
- **Thursday:** design and production  
- **Friday:** rehearsal and public sharing  

Each workshop ends with a *Friday night performance or showcase* — the “mini-studio” presenting what it has built.

These workshops act as prototypes for the larger studios: short enough to test, real enough to matter.

## Current Workshops

### 🦄 Unicornworld Imagineering — for Kids (ages 8–14)
Participants become *theme-park imagineers* designing a new zone for an invented park called **Unicornworld**.  
They sketch rides, write attraction names, draft back-stories, and pitch the whole zone on the final day.  
**Output:** a full design of one themed area — complete with signage, attractions, and slogans.  
**Learning:** teamwork, creative writing, presentation English, design language.

### 📰 Experience Worker Media — for Adults (ages 18+)  
A crash course in the studio that makes “The Dumb Traveler’s Guide to Bangkok.”  
Participants investigate a single topic — say *Pad Thai* or *Bangkok traffic* — and build a humorous, factual, and opinionated travel feature.  
**Output:** a short illustrated article fit for the Dumb Traveler site or zine.  
**Learning:** tone, register, cultural translation, research writing.

### 🎮 English Is Money — Mixed Ages (14+)  
An experimental gaming sprint that treats *English as currency.*  
Teams design and test a playable English-learning game in three sessions, using words, trade, and performance as mechanics.  
**Output:** a simple, playable prototype and live demo.  
**Learning:** negotiation, instruction writing, spontaneous speech, creative systems thinking.

## How It Works

Workshops are run by **Ben Shepard** and **Job Zheng**, often with a Thai co-teacher or apprentice.  
Groups range from **7–12 participants**.  
Before each workshop, every participant receives a short phone call from the instructor explaining the process and personalizing goals.

These intensives form the laboratory of the Rulebreakers method — the bridge between art research and functioning education.
