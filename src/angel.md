# A Call For A Very Special Angel Investor

We’re not seeking “a check.” We’re seeking a **partner** in Bangkok who sees the opportunity clearly and wants to help shape it.

---

## What We Need (Pilot Year)

- **Capital:** **฿4.2M** (~USD 120k) for a one-year pilot (see [Revenue](/revenue) for model).  
- **Place:** help securing a high-footfall storefront (MBK / Samyan-level).  
- **People & Doors:** intros to brands, malls, districts, and friendly officials.  
- **Patience:** a year of building, shipping, and learning in public.

**Use of Funds (illustrative)**  
- Rent & fit-out: ฿1.84M  
- People (3 teachers, 2 ops): ฿3.72M (run-rate; offset by tuition)  
- Equipment: ฿0.40M  
- Marketing / community: ฿0.30M  
- Admin / legal / utilities: ฿0.24M

*(Run-rate is covered by tuition in baseline; this raise de-risks launch & speed.)*

## What You Get

- An early, structured stake in the studios’ upside (pro-rata across sub-studios).  
- Rights to co-invest in spin-outs.  
- The chance to help birth a **repeatable miracle**.

---

## Why Us

- Ten years of IP already built (see [IP](/ip)).  
- A model that makes English **intrinsically rewarding**.  
- A school that doubles as a **studio ecosystem** (students share the upside; see [Ownership](/ownership)).
