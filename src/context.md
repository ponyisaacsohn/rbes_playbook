## Intellectual Context

Rulebreakers English Studios emerges from nearly a **decade of imaginary institutional creation** — a body of performance-based research exploring how art, education, and entrepreneurship overlap in Thailand’s rapidly transforming sociopolitical imaginary.

## Infinite Thailand

Our earliest project, **[Infinite Thailand](https://infinitethai.land)**, imagined a vast speculative network of Thai creative institutions — real, fake, and hybrid — that question how progress, prosperity, and imagination intertwine.  
It included projects like **Tunnelparks**, a proposed subterranean theme park system; **Chinatown 3.0**, a vision of urban renewal through cultural simulation; and dozens of temporary enterprises, schools, and campaigns.  

Each of these was both *fictional* and *operative* — built as if they already existed, so that people could act inside them. This method, later named **Institutional Performance Art**, now underpins how RBES builds its learning environments: as fully inhabitable fictions.

## The Rulebreakers Books

Over time, these works converged into what we call the **Rulebreakers Saga** — a series of speculative manuals, playbooks, and storyworlds that explore what education and enterprise might become if creativity and ownership were shared by all participants.

## From Imaginary to Operational

RBES is where those fictions become real enterprises. The Studios are not “inspired by” those projects — they *are* their continuation, built as a functioning version of the imaginary economy Infinite Thailand envisioned.  
In this sense, the school is both a prototype and a sequel.
