# Rulebreakers English Studios — Business Model & Budget

RBES creates value in two ways:

1. **Creative English outcomes** — students rapidly improve fluent, expressive English through institutional performance art.  
2. **Studio-born products** — sub-studios release IP, media, and experiences that make the world more beautiful and lovable.

These map to two value engines:

- **Tuition (recurring)** — target: upper / upper-middle-class Thais (youth paid by parents; adults self-pay).  
- **Studios as profit engines** — the school co-owns sub-studios and participates in venture upside.

## How We Model It

We show the economics **three ways**: per student → per studio → whole school.

> ✏️ All figures below are **baseline, editable assumptions** for the pilot year. Change the numbers right in this file and re-build.

### A) Per Student (Tuition Engine)

- **Monthly tuition (THB)**: **10,000**  
- **Learn-by-doing format**: studios produce real outputs → high motivation → faster acquisition  
- **Illustrative annual revenue per student**: **120,000 THB**

> Notes: price point targets the Bangkok upper/upper-middle market and can later tier by cohort, time-of-day, or studio prestige.

---

### B) Per Studio (Venture Engine)

- **Ownership logic**: RBES holds a negotiated **equity / rev-share** stake in each substudio’s outputs.  
- **Baseline net to school, per active studio (pilot year)**: **~200,000 THB** (after production costs / partner splits)  
- **Examples**:  
  - *Unicornworld Imagineering* → paid installations/licensing  
  - *Mean Babies Talent Mgmt* → IP options / content deals  
  - *Clownpump Press* → ad / sponsorship / print cycles  
  - *Experience Worker* → content + partner revenue
  - *Channel 99* → format licensing / venue tie-ins
  - *TMT Bottega* → prints/editions/commissions

> Metric to watch: **hit rate** of studio releases (e.g., 1–2 breakout products per 6 active studios).

---

### C) Whole-School (Pilot Year) — Baseline Scenario

**Scale (pilot):** 1 storefront, **3 teachers**, **2 staff**  
**Cohort size (avg in learning pods):** **60 students**  
**Active studios (shipping at least one product):** **6**

#### Revenue (THB)
- Tuition: `60 students × 10,000 × 12` → **7,200,000**  
- Studio profit-share: `6 × 200,000` → **1,200,000**  
**Total Revenue:** **8,400,000**

#### Costs (THB)
- **Rent** (storefront): `120,000 × 12` → **1,440,000**  
- **Teachers** (3 × 70,000 × 12) → **2,520,000**  
- **Staff / Ops** (2 × 50,000 × 12) → **1,200,000**  
- **Equipment & build-out** (one-time) → **400,000**  
- **Marketing / community** → **300,000**  
- **Admin / legal / utilities** → **240,000**  
**Total Costs:** **6,100,000**

**Illustrative Operating Margin:** **~2,300,000 THB**  
*(8.4M – 6.1M; excludes contingency; update as reality dictates.)*

## Ramp Logic

RBES **ramps beyond pilot** when BOTH are true:

1. **Proof of coverage:** Tuition + studio revenue ≥ total run-rate costs.  
2. **Unmet demand:** waitlist threshold hit (e.g., **30+** qualified students) _or_ studio backlog > 3 releases.

**Levers to scale:**
- Increase cohorts (80–120 students) / add time blocks  
- Open 2nd storefront or **mall “showroom studio”**  
- Spin out highest-performing studios into dedicated P&Ls

---

## Cost Structure (Editable Categories)

- **Rent** — mall unit / high-footfall adjacency  
- **People** — teachers, GM/ops, studio leads, part-time creators  
- **Equipment** — cameras, lights, audio, edit rigs, fabrication  
- **Marketing** — launch events, partnerships, creator seeding  
- **Admin** — legal, accounting, utilities, insurance  
- **Contingency** — 5–10% buffer (add as line item if desired)

---

## What Success Looks Like (12 Months)

- **Learning**: measurable English gains; portfolio of studio artifacts per student  
- **Business**: positive operating margin; 1–2 studio hits; growing waitlist  
- **Brand**: RBES recognized as *the* creative English path in Bangkok

---

### TL;DR

> **RBES = School + Studio Ecosystem.**  
> Tuition keeps the lights on; studio IP turns the lights into a stage.  
> When the stage is crowded (waitlist + hit-rate), we scale.
