    <h1>Meanbabies Management</h1>
<p>Meanbabies Management operates as a <strong>fictional talent-management company</strong> training artists to manage both themselves and others.</p>
<h3>The Myth</h3>
<p>The <em>Meanbabies</em> first appear in the Rulebreakers Saga as tiny, furious creatures carried by Holy Sloths—each one a parody of ego, fear, and control.<br>
Across the polyverse they kidnap heroes and must be rescued or integrated.</p>
<h3>The Studio</h3>
<p>In RBES, the studio helps participants <strong>work with their inner Meanbabies</strong>—the parts that block collaboration or creation.<br>
Through a system called <strong>Triadic Management</strong>, every participant is both manager and managed.<br>
Workshops simulate a functioning agency producing content from the Rulebreakers, FafaBaby, and StarKid universes.</p>
<h3>The Practice</h3>
<p>Each project begins with role assignment and negotiation sessions:<br>
artists wear “Meanbaby hats” or glasses to safely act out critical or possessive instincts.<br>
Teams then co-produce short works—videos, stories, prototypes—learning to convert friction into production.</p>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>Meanbabies Management teaches how to transform conflict into creative energy.<br>
When the studio eventually connects to the public, it will package cross-world characters and products emerging from RBES.</p>
