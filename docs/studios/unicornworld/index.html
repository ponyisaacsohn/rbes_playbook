    <h1>Unicornworld Imagineering</h1>
<p>Unicornworld Imagineering builds <strong>walk-in experiences</strong> where imagined worlds become places.</p>
<h3>The Myth</h3>
<p>Inside the <strong>Unicornworld Saga</strong>, the STAR unicorn <strong>Nichlolas</strong> lives in a chemically induced utopia—an endless, televised paradise owned by the Moraine Family Trust.<br>
The audience watches Nichlolas sing the Great Morning Song, invent new foods, and DJ waterfalls—never realizing the world is a zoo-show.<br>
The saga follows Nichlolas’ journey to find the <em>real</em> Unicornworld.</p>
<h3>The Studio</h3>
<p>For youth ~17–18 who want to design worlds you can walk through.<br>
Workshops focus on spatial storytelling and experiential architecture.<br>
Year-one project: a <strong>mall-scale photo/experience set</strong> where visitors invent and photograph their own characters and worlds.</p>
<h3>The Practice</h3>
<p>Students act as <strong>Imagineers</strong>: storyboards, environment sketches, small-scale fabrication.<br>
English is used for pitching, documentation, and collaboration—<strong>English as design software</strong>.</p>
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>Long-term vision: a <strong>real theme park</strong> combining zones from the <em>Unicornworld Saga</em>, <em>Rulebreakers Cycle</em>, and <em>FafaBaby Worlds</em>.</p>
