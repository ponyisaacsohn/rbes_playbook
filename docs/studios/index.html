    <h1>What Are These Studios?</h1>
<p>At Rulebreakers English Studios, learning happens by doing real work inside semi-fictional enterprises. Each studio functions as a pedagogical startup — a fiction structured to become real. Students join as collaborators and co-founders within a living creative ecosystem. English becomes the working language of design, production, and imagination.</p>
<h2>How Learning Generates Value</h2>
<p>Students at RBES learn English by doing meaningful creative work that can also generate real revenue.<br>
Practice in the studios improves language ability, while performance in those same studios can create income and shared ownership.</p>
