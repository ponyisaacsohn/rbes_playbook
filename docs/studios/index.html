    <h2>The Studios</h2>
<p>At Rulebreakers English Studios, <strong>each studio is both a classroom and a company</strong> — an imaginary enterprise that teaches English through performance, collaboration, and creative production.<br>
Students don’t study English; they <em>run</em> institutions in English. Every team builds real media, research, and design outputs that become part of the Rulebreakers ecosystem.</p>
<p>Each studio focuses on a distinct discipline — from journalism to worldbuilding — but all share the same goal: learning through <em>doing real things that matter</em>.</p>

<h2>How the Studios Work</h2>
<p>Each studio operates as a <strong>semi-autonomous company</strong> inside the larger RBES ecosystem.<br>
Participants join teams for defined cycles (usually 6–12 weeks). Each cycle ends with a <em>real output</em> — an exhibition, publication, or product that can stand in the world.</p>
<p>English emerges naturally from these processes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Writing</strong> becomes documentation and publication.</li>
<li><strong>Speaking</strong> becomes pitching, interviewing, or performing.</li>
<li><strong>Listening and Reading</strong> become research, collaboration, and response.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of each cycle, students have not just improved fluency — they’ve built things that actually exist.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Long-Term Goal</h2>
<p>Together, the studios form a <strong>microcity of learning institutions</strong>, each with its own culture and economy.<br>
The eventual vision is for these studios to sustain themselves as small, interconnected ventures — collectively forming the first <em>Rulebreakers Campus.</em></p>
