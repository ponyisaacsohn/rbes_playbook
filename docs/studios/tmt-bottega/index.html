    <h1>TMT — The Transpersonal Making Team</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;When the work begins to make you, something greater has entered the studio.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>1. What Is Transpersonal Making?</h2>
<p>The <strong>“transpersonal”</strong> comes from <em>transpersonal psychology</em> — a branch of study born in the late 1960s to explore experiences that transcend the boundaries of the individual self.<br>
Its earliest subjects were mystical experiences, psychedelic visions, and spiritual awakenings — but it soon extended into <strong>creative practice</strong>, where the same ego-dissolving force appears in the act of making.</p>
<p>In other words, <em>to make transpersonally is to make beyond oneself.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>2. Collaboration and the “Third Mind”</h2>
<p>Writers <strong>William S. Burroughs</strong> and <strong>Brion Gysin</strong> coined the phrase <strong>“The Third Mind”</strong> to describe the emergent intelligence that appears whenever two creators truly collaborate.<br>
Something larger than either person starts making decisions.<br>
The painting paints the painter.<br>
The writing writes the writer.<br>
The work becomes a participant in its own creation.</p>
<p>That’s what TMT studies and practices — <em>art as a cooperative trance.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>3. Transpersonal Media</h2>
<p>TMT operates across three domains, each with its own rituals and experiments:</p>
<h3>🖌️ Transpersonally Made Paintings</h3>
<p>Paintings that depict — and are made within — altered collaborative states.<br>
Each piece attempts to visualize what cannot normally be seen: <em>the field of shared imagination.</em></p>
<h3>📷 Transpersonal Photography</h3>
<p>Images produced through guided sessions in which both subject and photographer enter a mutual perceptual flow.<br>
The resulting photos seem to come from a third observer in the room.</p>
<h3>💠 Transpersonal Pixels</h3>
<p>Digital works, from video to design systems, that use algorithmic co-creation and generative tools as spiritual instruments — pixels guided by intuition and emergence rather than control.</p>
<hr>
<h2>4. Why a “Team”?</h2>
<p>Because transpersonal art is never truly solitary.<br>
Even when you work alone, you collaborate with <strong>past and future selves</strong>, with the medium itself, and with the field of attention that arises around the work.<br>
TMT is structured as a <strong>collective atelier</strong> inside Rulebreakers English Studios — a place where painters, coders, writers, and dreamers can co-enter this space together.</p>
<hr>
<h2>5. Sample Works</h2>
<h3><em>“The Tricksmith’s Pet”</em></h3>
<p>Detail from a collaborative painting exploring the paradox of playful control — who is painting whom?</p>
<h3><em>“I See a Face”</em></h3>
<p>An experiment in pareidolia and shared perception.<br>
Do you see the same face the artist saw?</p>
<h3><em>Block City Bridges</em></h3>
<p>A transpersonal photograph — neither staged nor accidental — where the Third Mind itself seems to compose the geometry.</p>
<hr>
<h2>6. Invitation</h2>
<p>TMT is open to new collaborators, apprentices, and visiting spirits.<br>
If you have ever felt that a piece of art was <em>making you</em>, you already belong here.</p>
