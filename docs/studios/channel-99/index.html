    <h1>Channel 99</h1>
<p>Channel 99 is RBES’s streaming studio and production network—where fiction and reality are co-produced.</p>
<h3>The Structure</h3>
<p>The studio contains three production companies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CoGirls Productions</strong> – creators of <em>CoGirls Café</em>, a sitcom that doubles as a real café in Bangkok.</li>
<li><strong>C30 Pictures</strong> – produces films for viewers 30 and over, confronting the <em>Finite Timeline</em> through cautionary storytelling.</li>
<li><strong>Idiot Pictures</strong> – makes <em>wissenkunst</em> films: art-history, philosophy, and politics told as pleasure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Method</h3>
<p>Workshops operate like real production rooms: writing, casting, directing, editing.<br>
English functions as the shared production language—scripts, budgets, and meetings are all done in English.</p>
<h3>The Purpose</h3>
<p>Channel 99 documents both timelines—the worlds that could end, and those that might continue.<br>
It trains participants to speak and collaborate across fiction and fact.</p>
