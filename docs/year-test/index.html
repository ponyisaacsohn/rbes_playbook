    <h1>The Year-Long Test of Concept</h1>
<p>Up to this point, everything in Rulebreakers English Studios has been speculation — ideas, models, and imagination.</p>
<p>The Year-Long Test of Concept is designed to change that. It is the experiment that will prove whether the method actually works — whether people can learn English faster and better by running make-believe institutions that generate real value.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>The goal is straightforward: to demonstrate that Rulebreakers English Studios can function as both an effective educational system and a self-sustaining creative business.</p>
<p>The test year will measure whether our structure — part school, part enterprise — can operate continuously, produce measurable language growth, and finance itself through studio activity.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>The experiment runs from <strong>June 2025 to June 2026</strong> in a <strong>storefront in Bangkok</strong>. It is divided into four twelve-week cycles, each containing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Studio Operations</strong> – participants work inside one of nine studios to produce tangible outputs: media, design, architecture, and games.</li>
<li><strong>Workshop Weeks</strong> – open three-day sessions for new participants and rapid prototyping.</li>
<li><strong>Showcase &amp; Reflection</strong> – public exhibitions, publications, and evaluation of results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Around <strong>30 paying participants</strong> form the initial cohort. Their tuition provides the operational base for staff, teachers, and materials — allowing the studios themselves to operate as functioning creative companies.</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Storefront</h3>
<p>The storefront serves as both <strong>workspace and display</strong> — a transparent creative office where the studios are visible to the public.</p>
<p>Passersby can enter, observe, or purchase outcomes: publications, games, performances, or small-scale designs. Each week a different studio leads operations, keeping the space alive with new work.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p>The year tests two linked hypotheses:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Educational Proof</strong> — that participants’ English improves faster through creation, negotiation, and collaboration than through conventional instruction.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Proof</strong> — that a school built as a creative enterprise can sustain itself through its own production, workshops, and events.</li>
</ol>
<p>Metrics will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Documented student progress in writing, fluency, and collaboration.</li>
<li>Tangible cultural output: media, exhibits, and client prototypes.</li>
<li>Financial balance sheets for each studio.</li>
<li>Public and institutional engagement.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<p>By <strong>June 2026</strong>, the year should yield:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <strong>verified educational framework</strong> demonstrating clear language progress through creative production.</li>
<li>A <strong>working business model</strong> for a sustainable, scalable Rulebreakers English Studios.</li>
<li>A <strong>public archive</strong> documenting the entire year — its outputs, finances, and learning data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Everything before this has been theory.<br>
This is the year we find out if it works.</p>
