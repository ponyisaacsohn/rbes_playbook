    <h2>The Year-Long Test of Concept</h2>
<p>The <strong>Year-Long Test of Concept</strong> is our hypothesis:<br>
what happens if Rulebreakers English Studios runs continuously for a full year?</p>
<p>The goal is to observe, document, and measure the method in real operation —<br>
to see whether an institution built on <em>Osmotic Learning</em> can sustain itself pedagogically, socially, and structurally.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Framework</h2>
<p>The experiment runs from <strong>June 2025 → June 2026</strong> and is divided into four twelve-week cycles.<br>
Each cycle includes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Studio Operations</strong> — each participant works within a studio to produce tangible output.</li>
<li><strong>Workshop Weeks</strong> — intensive three-day pop-ups for new participants and idea testing.</li>
<li><strong>Showcase &amp; Reflection</strong> — public sharing, internal evaluation, and publication of results.</li>
</ol>
<p>The year serves as both curriculum and prototype: a working proof that the studios can educate and operate simultaneously.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Core Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Can <em>Osmotic Learning</em> produce measurable language acquisition without direct instruction?</li>
<li>Can studios generate and document real cultural and educational value?</li>
<li>How do authorship, ownership, and performance interact inside a make-believe institution?</li>
<li>What kind of data and artifacts can a living school produce?</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Metrics</h2>
<p><strong>Language Development</strong> – weekly written and spoken documentation from participants.<br>
<strong>Cultural Output</strong> – media, games, texts, performances generated by studios.<br>
<strong>Institutional Data</strong> – logs of operations, decision-making, and internal structures.<br>
<strong>Social Viability</strong> – enrollment, engagement, collaborative retention.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>By the end of the year we expect two deliverables:</p>
<ol>
<li>A repeatable educational framework demonstrating the effectiveness of <em>Osmotic Learning</em>.</li>
<li>A functioning institutional model that operates as both artwork and enterprise.</li>
</ol>
<p>This year is the bridge from idea to institution.</p>
