    <h1>The Intellectual Property Already Created</h1>
<p>For a decade we (Job Zheng &amp; Ben Shepard) have been building IP platforms that now feed directly into <strong>Rulebreakers English Studios</strong>. RBES is not starting from zero — it’s a <strong>port of a living universe</strong> into a school.</p>
<p>We narrate that universe briefly below. External links go out to prior work; internal links point to RBES pages you can explore now or as we publish more.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Unicornworld Imagineering → “Designing the impossible, then making it normal.”</h2>
<p>An ongoing practice for building <strong>fantasy environments</strong> that behave like real places. Mall-scale installations, ride concepts, and the long-arc worldbuilding behind <em>Rulebreakers</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>First stop: <em>The Happiest Place in the Mall</em> (Bangkok; installation).</li>
<li>At RBES: students co-design props, sets, and micro-attractions for public showings.</li>
<li>See also: <a href="/studios/unicornworld/">Studios</a> (internal) · <a href="/revenue">Revenue</a></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Mean Babies Talent Management → “Cute, chaotic IP for all ages.”</h2>
<p>A character/IP lab (e.g., <strong>FAFA BABY</strong>) and production wrapper for shorts, music, and merch. Built to test <strong>hit-making</strong> inside the school.</p>
<ul>
<li>At RBES: writers’ room + animation sprints + drops.</li>
<li>See: <a href="/studios/mean-babies/">Studios</a> (internal)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Clownpump Press → “Kids make culture.”</h2>
<p>A newspaper / zine / imprint where <strong>students write, illustrate, and ship</strong>. Ads &amp; sponsors keep the presses on; serialized fiction connects to Rulebreakers’ macro-story.</p>
<ul>
<li>At RBES: monthly issues, special editions, and compendia.</li>
<li>See: <a href="/studios/clownpump/">Studios</a> (internal)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Channel 99 → “Reality-sitcom becomes reality-business.”</h2>
<p>Formats that blur show ↔ venue ↔ enterprise. Students learn English by <strong>pitching, producing, and operating</strong> pop-up experiences that the content itself advertises.</p>
<ul>
<li>At RBES: pilot “micro-shows,” licensing-ready formats.</li>
<li>See: <a href="/studios/channel-99/">Studios</a> (internal)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Experience Worker Media → “Travel and lifestyle for the post-tourist.”</h2>
<p>Guides, feeds, and toolkits built by students in the city-as-campus.</p>
<ul>
<li>At RBES: field assignments → content → partners.</li>
<li>See: <a href="/studios/experience-worker/">Studios</a> (internal)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Social Arcology Lab → “City-scale imagination.”</h2>
<p>Civic prototypes that connect markets to public space (e.g., <strong>Tunnelparks</strong>). Students learn to speak policy and business in the same breath.</p>
<ul>
<li>Read more: <a href="http://infinitethai.land">Infinite Thai Land</a> (external)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>English Is Money (Gaming) → “Incentives make fluency inevitable.”</h2>
<p>Game loops that <strong>reward English-in-use</strong>, not test-taking.</p>
<ul>
<li>At RBES: studio-built challenges, partner pilots.</li>
<li>See: <a href="/revenue">Revenue</a></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>TMT Bottega → “Transpersonal painting and editions.”</h2>
<p>A studio that lets students join fine-art production lines: from editions to commissions.</p>
<ul>
<li>At RBES: gallery window + marketplace experiments.</li>
<li>See: <a href="/studios/tmt-bottega/">Studios</a> (internal)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>The Rulebreakers Storyworld</h2>
<p>The literary backbone — characters, places, and rules — that show up in classes, sets, and live pieces.</p>
<ul>
<li>Read soon: /library/rulebreakers-book-1/ (internal placeholder)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Why this matters for RBES</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motivation:</strong> students aren’t “pretending to learn” — they’re joining worlds that already ship.</li>
<li><strong>Monetization:</strong> IP → products → profit-share (see <a href="/ownership">Ownership</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> each file is both a tool and an artwork.</li>
</ul>
