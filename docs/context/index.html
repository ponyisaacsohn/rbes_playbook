    <h2>Intellectual Context</h2>
<p>Rulebreakers English Studios emerges from nearly a <strong>decade of imaginary institutional creation</strong> — a body of performance-based research exploring how art, education, and entrepreneurship overlap in Thailand’s rapidly transforming sociopolitical imaginary.</p>
<h2>Infinite Thailand</h2>
<p>Our earliest project, <strong><a href="https://infinitethai.land">Infinite Thailand</a></strong>, imagined a vast speculative network of Thai creative institutions — real, fake, and hybrid — that question how progress, prosperity, and imagination intertwine.<br>
It included projects like <strong>Tunnelparks</strong>, a proposed subterranean theme park system; <strong>Chinatown 3.0</strong>, a vision of urban renewal through cultural simulation; and dozens of temporary enterprises, schools, and campaigns.</p>
<p>Each of these was both <em>fictional</em> and <em>operative</em> — built as if they already existed, so that people could act inside them. This method, later named <strong>Institutional Performance Art</strong>, now underpins how RBES builds its learning environments: as fully inhabitable fictions.</p>
<h2>The Rulebreakers Books</h2>
<p>Over time, these works converged into what we call the <strong>Rulebreakers Saga</strong> — a series of speculative manuals, playbooks, and storyworlds that explore what education and enterprise might become if creativity and ownership were shared by all participants.</p>

<h2>From Imaginary to Operational</h2>
<p>RBES is where those fictions become real enterprises. The Studios are not “inspired by” those projects — they <em>are</em> their continuation, built as a functioning version of the imaginary economy Infinite Thailand envisioned.<br>
In this sense, the school is both a prototype and a sequel.</p>
