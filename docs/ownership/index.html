    <h1>The Student Ownership System (SOS)</h1>
<h2>0. What It Is</h2>
<p>The <strong>Student Ownership System (SOS)</strong> makes every student a co-owner in the Rulebreakers Studios.<br>
When a studio earns money — from ticket sales, consulting projects, game launches, art commissions, or media rights — the students who helped build those projects share the profits.</p>
<p>This means that the same people learning to create value are also the ones who receive it.<br>
Every participant is both a <strong>student</strong> and a <strong>stakeholder.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>1. How It Works</h2>
<p>Each student receives a small ownership share — expressed as <strong>Studio Points</strong> — in the studio or sub-project they help to build.<br>
These points track contribution (time, effort, creativity, leadership) and translate into real payout when a project makes money.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Component</th>
<th>Function</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Studio Points</strong></td>
<td>Track contribution and determine profit share.</td>
<td>A student who leads design for a Channel 99 show earns more points than a guest actor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Ownership Ledger</strong></td>
<td>Transparent record of who contributed what, and how much revenue is owed.</td>
<td>The ledger updates after each production, launch, or event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Payout Cycle</strong></td>
<td>Revenue distributed quarterly or at project close.</td>
<td>Income from an exhibition, client project, or online release gets divided automatically.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<h2>2. What This Means in Practice</h2>
<p>Each Rulebreakers Studio has its own potential revenue path — and students share in those outcomes:</p>
<table>

<tr>
<th>Studio</th>
<th>Example of Real Revenue</th>
<th>How Students Benefit</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Unicornworld Imagineering</strong></td>
<td>Admission fees from immersive park environments and public installations.</td>
<td>Students who designed attractions receive a share of ticket sales.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Mean Babies Management</strong></td>
<td>Merchandising, licensing of original characters, brand collaborations.</td>
<td>Students who develop and manage “talent” receive royalties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Clownpump Press</strong></td>
<td>Book and zine sales, print-on-demand editions.</td>
<td>Contributors receive proportional payouts for each sold copy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Channel 99</strong></td>
<td>Advertising, streaming partnerships, live events.</td>
<td>Cast, editors, and producers share income when content monetizes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Experience Worker</strong></td>
<td>Corporate workshops, design consulting, applied research.</td>
<td>Adult learners who deliver client work share consulting fees.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>English Is Money Gaming</strong></td>
<td>Entry fees, sponsorships, and in-game marketplace activity.</td>
<td>Players, designers, and moderators earn from total game revenue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>TMT Bottega</strong></td>
<td>Commissions, exhibition sales, or digital art editions.</td>
<td>Artists and facilitators share profits from sold works.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Social Arcology Lab</strong></td>
<td>Grants and development funds for social prototypes.</td>
<td>Research teams share project budgets and outcomes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Infinite Thailand Solutions</strong></td>
<td>Cultural consulting, government and NGO contracts.</td>
<td>Analysts and project designers receive proportional revenue.</td>

<p><em>(These figures are examples — actual shares depend on contribution, revenue type, and studio performance.)</em></p>
<p>The principle is simple: <strong>if a studio makes money, everyone who built it earns money.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>4. Why It Matters</h2>
<p>The SOS closes the gap between learning and livelihood.<br>
Instead of paying only for a class, students build enterprises that can return income to them.<br>
This creates behavioral alignment: when studios succeed, learning itself becomes profitable.</p>
<p>Ownership transforms motivation from abstract (“get better at English”) to concrete (“help launch this show, earn real money, and improve your English doing it”).<br>
It turns education into a working creative economy.</p>
<hr>
<h2>5. The Bigger Picture</h2>
<p>The SOS is the microeconomic model inside <strong>∞泰 (Infinite Thailand)</strong> — the national-scale framework where education and enterprise merge.<br>
As more studios connect, the shared ownership system becomes a distributed creative economy: thousands of small student-owners driving Thailand’s next creative generation.</p>
