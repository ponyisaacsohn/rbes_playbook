    <h2>Theory</h2>
<p><strong>The Rulebreakers English Method</strong> is based on <strong>Osmotic Learning</strong> —<br>
learning that occurs through immersion in a meaningful, designed environment.</p>
<p>Osmotic Learning can be expressed as an equation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dewey + Vygotsky + Krashen + Institutional Performance Art = Osmotic Learning</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each component contributes a mechanism of learning proven through research.</p>
<hr>
<h2>(1) John Dewey — Learning by Doing</h2>
<p>Dewey proposed that knowledge is created through <em>experience and reflection</em>, not passive instruction.<br>
His principle of <strong>Project-Based Learning</strong> (Dewey, <em>Experience and Education</em>, 1938) laid the groundwork for modern experiential education.<br>
A meta-analysis by Hmelo-Silver (2004) found that project-based environments increase motivation, retention, and conceptual understanding.</p>
<p><strong>At RBES:</strong> every session is a project. Students learn English by designing, building, and presenting real outputs.</p>
<hr>
<h2>(2) Lev Vygotsky — Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) &amp; Scaffolding</h2>
<p>Vygotsky’s theory (1978) describes learning as a social process: students progress when supported by peers or mentors just beyond their current ability.<br>
Scaffolding theory, extended by Wood, Bruner &amp; Ross (1976), formalized this mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>At RBES:</strong> studios are built as collaborative scaffolds.<br>
Students and instructors co-perform tasks, and English emerges as the shared working language inside that collaboration.</p>
<hr>
<h2>(3) Stephen Krashen — The Affective Filter</h2>
<p>Krashen’s <em>Affective Filter Hypothesis</em> (1977) identifies emotional state as the gatekeeper of language acquisition.<br>
When anxiety is low and motivation is high, input becomes intake.<br>
MacIntyre &amp; Gardner (1991) confirmed that positive affect strongly correlates with L2 fluency.</p>
<p><strong>At RBES:</strong> the studios remove the anxiety of performance by turning it into play.<br>
There are no tests, only projects that matter.</p>
<hr>
<h2>(4) Institutional Performance Art (IPA)</h2>
<p>Developed within contemporary art by practitioners like <strong>Tania Bruguera</strong>, IPA treats the institution itself as a medium.<br>
The artwork is not an object but a functioning structure.<br>
In this model, behavior, administration, and context become the performance.</p>
<p><strong>At RBES:</strong> the school <em>is</em> the artwork.<br>
Running it is the method. Every administrative act is also pedagogical; the institution teaches by being lived.</p>
<hr>
<h2>(5) Synthesis — Osmotic Learning</h2>
<p>When we combine these four components, the result is <strong>Osmotic Learning</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>Osmotic Learning = Environment × Motivation × Meaning</strong></p>
<p>Students acquire language because they are immersed in a world they help design, operate, and believe in.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Implication</h2>
<p>Traditional education separates <em>what is learned</em> from <em>why it matters.</em><br>
Osmotic Learning reunites them.<br>
Rulebreakers English Studios exists to demonstrate that when form and function merge, learning becomes performance.</p>
