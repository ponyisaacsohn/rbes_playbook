    <h1>Who We Are and How We Came Up With the Rulebreaker Method</h1>
<p>Although we finally discovered the key to the Rulebreaker Method in a <a href="https://spiellandschaft.de/minimuenchen/">miniature city run entirely by children</a>, the story actually begins in 2014 on the South Side of Chicago, with a fake mayoral campaign for Kanye West that unexpectedly went viral.</p>
<p>We’re Ben Shepard and Job Zheng, institutional performance artists and co-founders of <a href="/theory/">Rulebreakers English Studios</a>.</p>
<p>In 2014, Ben created the <a href="https://archive.is/Ydz40">website for a hypothetical campaign for Kanye West to become Mayor of Chicago</a>. Word of the site spread fast—from a local blog to BET, MTV, and the <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-kanye-west-mayor-campaign-20141113-story.html"><em>Chicago Tribune</em></a>. Although West chose a very different political path, the impact of that simple site revealed the power of these kinds of imaginary institutions.</p>
<p>We met in 2016 in Shanghai, fell in love, and immediately began performing institutions. Our first collaboration was <strong>早房</strong> — <em>Dawn House</em> — an experimental residential school. Over the next few years, we continued to perform these fictional institutions: a cooperative bike company in Ho Chi Minh City, a conceptual consulting firm, and a series of ephemeral studios that blurred the line between art and enterprise.</p>
<p>In 2021, we enrolled together at the <a href="https://www.udk-berlin.de/en/">Institut für Kunst im Kontext</a> at Berlin’s <em>Universität der Künste</em> — the Institute for Art in Context at the University of the Arts. We wanted to take our institutional performances to the next scale and hoped the German progressive art-academic system would help us do so. It didn’t, but we did become the first research fellows at <a href="https://spiellandschaft.de/minimuenchen/">Mini-München</a>, also known as the <em>Spielstadt</em>.</p>
<p>Every two years, for three weeks each summer, about four thousand children between the ages of 7 and 15 come together to create a small city—complete with a representative government, stock market, university, television station, theater, and dozens of craft workshops: leather-making, print-making, scent-making.</p>
<p>No classes, but so much learning. Learning how to run a government, a stock exchange, how to make movies, perfume, paintings, newspapers. Perhaps the child playing judge in the Mini-München Court didn’t think of herself as an institutional performance artist—but we saw the connection. Extended make-believe makes people passionate to learn.</p>
<p>Here is three-quarters of the Rulebreakers Method: make learning English fun by using it in extended make-believe — institutional performance — the <a href="/studios/">studios</a>. The other quarter: try to make the make-believe real. Have the consultants really consult. The imagineers really imagineer.</p>
<p>We are now raising funds to open a <a href="/year-test/">year-long proof-of-concept storefront</a> to demonstrate this model at scale. Until then, we’re running as many <a href="/workshops/">workshops</a> as possible to test the idea and refine the method.</p>
