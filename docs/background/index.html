    <h1>Who We Are and How We Discovered the Rulebreakers English Method</h1>
<p>Rulebreakers English Studios was founded by <strong>Ben Shepard</strong> and <strong>Job Zheng</strong>, married collaborators since 2016 who create what they call <em>institutional performance art</em>—extended, adult make-believe organizations that function like real ones.</p>
<p>Ben studied at the <strong>University of Chicago</strong> under performance artist <strong>Tania Bruguera</strong>, whose works—<em>Cathedra Arte</em>, <em>Immigrant Movement International</em>, <em>The Hannah Arendt Institute</em>—stage institutions as the artwork itself.  Already in college, Ben began making his own fictive systems: a temporary city on the Midway, a post-apocalyptic commune, and then <strong>Kanye 4 Mayor</strong>, a fake campaign for Kanye West to become mayor of Chicago.  The project went unexpectedly viral, appearing on MTV and BET—his first proof of how powerful institutional performance could be.</p>
<p>Job and Ben met in <strong>Shanghai</strong>, both creating fictional organizations—fake art schools, studios, and collectives such as <em>ZaoFang</em> and <em>Dawn House</em> (造房, “to build a house”).  Wanting deeper context, they applied to Berlin’s <strong>Universität der Künste / Institute for Art in Context</strong>, where they focused formally on institutional performance art.  While there, they served as the first research fellows at <strong>Mini-München</strong>, a child-run model city that re-creates urban life each summer.</p>
<p>At Mini-München they made their key discovery: children worked with astonishing intensity and joy.  They loved performing institutional life—running restaurants, designing bus routes, administering fake governments.  This observation—combined with their art practice and with linguist <strong>Stephen Krashen’s</strong> <em>Affective Filter</em> hypothesis (the idea that anxiety blocks language acquisition while play and purpose open it)—led to the concept of a new kind of English school.</p>
<p>That school became <strong>Rulebreakers English Studios</strong>: a living artwork that teaches English by having students perform imaginary but functional organizations—theme parks, newspapers, architecture firms, studios, and startups.  It is a synthesis of art research, educational theory, and practical enterprise.</p>
