    <h2>The Workshops</h2>
<p>Before building full studios, Rulebreakers English Studios tests each idea in miniature.<br>
Each <strong>workshop</strong> is a <em>three-day, three-hour</em> sprint that condenses a studio into a single intensive burst of collaboration.<br>
The format is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wednesday:</strong> concept and immersion</li>
<li><strong>Thursday:</strong> design and production</li>
<li><strong>Friday:</strong> rehearsal and public sharing</li>
</ul>
<p>Each workshop ends with a <em>Friday night performance or showcase</em> — the “mini-studio” presenting what it has built.</p>
<p>These workshops act as prototypes for the larger studios: short enough to test, real enough to matter.</p>

<h2>Current Workshops</h2>
<h3>🦄 Unicornworld Imagineering — for Kids (ages 8–14)</h3>
<p>Participants become <em>theme-park imagineers</em> designing a new zone for an invented park called <strong>Unicornworld</strong>.<br>
They sketch rides, write attraction names, draft back-stories, and pitch the whole zone on the final day.<br>
<strong>Output:</strong> a full design of one themed area — complete with signage, attractions, and slogans.<br>
<strong>Learning:</strong> teamwork, creative writing, presentation English, design language.</p>
<hr>
<h3>📰 Experience Worker Media — for Adults (ages 18+)</h3>
<p>A crash course in the studio that makes “The Dumb Traveler’s Guide to Bangkok.”<br>
Participants investigate a single topic — say <em>Pad Thai</em> or <em>Bangkok traffic</em> — and build a humorous, factual, and opinionated travel feature.<br>
<strong>Output:</strong> a short illustrated article fit for the Dumb Traveler site or zine.<br>
<strong>Learning:</strong> tone, register, cultural translation, research writing.</p>
<hr>
<h3>🎮 English Is Money — Mixed Ages (14+)</h3>
<p>An experimental gaming sprint that treats <em>English as currency.</em><br>
Teams design and test a playable English-learning game in three sessions, using words, trade, and performance as mechanics.<br>
<strong>Output:</strong> a simple, playable prototype and live demo.<br>
<strong>Learning:</strong> negotiation, instruction writing, spontaneous speech, creative systems thinking.</p>
<hr>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>Workshops are run by <strong>Ben Shepard</strong> and <strong>Job Zheng</strong>, often with a Thai co-teacher or apprentice.<br>
Groups range from <strong>7–12 participants</strong>.<br>
Before each workshop, every participant receives a short phone call from the instructor explaining the process and personalizing goals.</p>
<p>These intensives form the laboratory of the Rulebreakers method — the bridge between art research and functioning education.</p>
